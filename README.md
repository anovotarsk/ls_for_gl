# ls_for_gl

Hi)

This project has implemented much more than the task requires.
Together with Artur Lyashuk (https://github.com/AEVVEL), 
we performed a similar task in UNIT Facktory, but for MacOS. 
I adapted the project for linux, 
but some functions may not work quite like 
the LS utility (sorting, multi-column output, etc.)
